# System Design & Patterns Guide

> In modern software development, building scalable and maintainable systems requires more than writing functional code — it demands strong **architectural thinking** and solid **design principles**. This guide is a structured knowledge base covering core **system design** concepts, widely used **design patterns**, and architectural best practices to help design reliable, scalable, and maintainable **software systems**.
